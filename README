## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does the ELO rating system work?
The ELO system calculates fair ratings based on match results. When a lower-rated player beats a higher-rated player, they gain more points. This ensures rankings accurately reflect skill levels.

### Can I create multiple scoreboards?
Yes! You can create unlimited offline scoreboards and join multiple online scoreboards.

### Is my data safe?
Yes. Your data is stored securely using Supabase. We never share or sell your data.

### How do I delete my account?
Send an email to contact.nordicworks@gmail.com with the subject "Delete my account" and include your registered email address. We'll delete your account within 72 hours.

Currently, ELO Rankings supports 1v1 competitions only. Team support may be added in future updates.
